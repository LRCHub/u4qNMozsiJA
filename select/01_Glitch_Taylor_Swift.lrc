[00:03.31] We were supposed to be just friends
[00:08.35] You don't live in my part of town, but maybe I'll see you out some weekend
[00:15.34] Depending on what kind of mood and situation-ship I'm in
[00:19.98] And what's in my system
[00:31.48] 
[00:24.45] I think there's been a glitch, oh, yeah
[00:28.89] Five seconds later, I'm fastening myself to you with a stitch, oh, yeah
[00:34.92] And I'm not even sorry
[00:36.58] Nights are so starry, blood moonlit
[00:40.63] It must be counterfeit
[00:45.08] I think there's been a glitch, oh, yeah
[01:04.58] 
[00:51.05] I was supposed to sweat you out
[00:55.43] In search of glorious happenings of happenstance on someone else's playground
[01:02.47] But it's been two thousand one hundred and 90 days of our love blackout
[01:08.07] The system's breaking down (the system's breaking down)
[01:35.57] 
[01:12.15] I think there's been a glitch
[01:16.56] Five seconds later, I'm fastening myself to you with a stitch
[01:22.36] And I'm not even sorry
[01:24.35] Nights are so starry, blood moonlit
[01:28.46] It must be counterfeit
[01:32.72] I think there's been a glitch
[01:47.22] 
[01:39.99] A brief interruption, a slight malfunction
[01:43.33] I'd go back to wanting dudes who give nothing
[01:46.85] I thought we had no chance
[01:50.34] And that's romance, let's dance
[02:05.84] 
[01:57.98] Glitch
[02:01.23] Five seconds later, I'm fastening myself to you with a stitch
[02:07.02] And I'm not even sorry
[02:08.94] Nights are so starry, blood moonlit
[02:13.00] It must be counterfeit
[02:17.38] I think there's been a glitch
