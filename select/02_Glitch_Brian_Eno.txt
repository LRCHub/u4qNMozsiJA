There is a glitch in thesystem
Outside thebrain flow
Armoured shells melt down
Explode in themain code
Seigedby the blind mass
They won't stop the chain grow
Numbers grow numbers
Working ants or quantumfires
Will flow on regardless
Of each abandoned carcas
The only joy there is - is search onward through the darkness
Edict states thelights go out
Learn to fight the nightfall

Work will lead to comfort
Comfort lives a lifetime
But death is not an ending
It's a place to search the light with

Light inuniversal terms
Cells out on the great grid
Numbers growingnumbers
Working ants, quantumfires
Morph from theenergy
Abandoned by each carcas
The greatest joy there is - is onward search through the darkness
